# BagelOS
This is an Arduino-based "operating system" that uses the TVout library.
To use this, wire a 1K OHM resistor to pin 9 of your Arduino, and a 470 OHM resistor to pin 7.  Wire the other end of both resistors to the center pin of an RCA plug.  Connect ground to the outside of the plug.  Wire a pushbutton between pin 13 and ground.
Plug the other end of the RCA cable into a display, and upload the included sketch to your Arduino.
